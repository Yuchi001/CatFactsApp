# Cat Facts Blackjack Game

This project consists of a backend and a frontend that work together to create a fun and interactive game simulating Blackjack using cat facts!

## Project Overview

The backend provides a set of random cat facts, and the frontend allows users to play a simplified version of Blackjack. The game mechanics are based on cat facts, and players aim to reach 9 stacks without exceeding it. Each "Hit Me!" gives you a new cat fact, and for each occurrence of the word "cat" in the fact, you receive a stack.

### Important!
- **Goal:** The objective is to get as close as possible to 9 stacks without exceeding that number.
- **Hit Me! Button:** Get a new cat fact, and earn a stack for every occurrence of the word "cat."
- **Enough! Button:** Once you're satisfied with your stacks, click this button to compare your score with the computerâ€™s score.
- **Save Facts:** You can save the facts you've received, but they will reset if you lose the game!
